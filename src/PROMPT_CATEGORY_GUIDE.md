## Prompt Writing Philosophy

### What Makes a Great Prompt?

1. **Specific enough** to spark a clear memory or thought
   - ❌ "Tell us about yourself"
   - ✅ "What's your weirdest sleep habit?"

2. **Universal enough** that everyone can answer
   - ❌ "What was your first marathon like?"
   - ✅ "What's a physical challenge you're proud of completing?"

3. **Example-driven** to reduce "I don't know what to say" paralysis
   - Always include a real, human example
   - Make it slightly vulnerable to model the target tone

4. **Open-ended** to prevent yes/no answers
   - Use "What" and "How" questions
   - Avoid questions that can be answered in one word

5. **Emotionally honest** about the target depth
   - Light prompts can be silly
   - Deep prompts should acknowledge weight: "What wound are you still healing from?"
